# Movie Recommendation-System

The implementation of recommendation systems has played a significant role in the growth of online streaming platforms. Developing effective recommender engines can provide a multitude of benefits for companies, such as improving customer experiences, simplifying transactions, and fostering customer loyalty. Internally, these systems can boost sales and retention rates. This project will focus on using collaborative filtering techniques to predict user ratings for movies that have not yet been viewed, based on existing ratings.
Through the use of collaborative filters in our movie recommendation system, our objective is to tackle the following issues:
1. Predict the ratings of popular movies like La La Land, Dunkirk, and Birdman for group members, as well as less popular films such as Winter's Bone, Son of Saul, and A Serious Man. 
2. Predict movie ratings for new customers and forecast their ratings after obtaining new data.
